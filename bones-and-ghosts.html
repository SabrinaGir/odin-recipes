    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>While I know no one is ever actually scared by spooky Halloween treats, I do know for a fact that many people are terrified to work with meringue. Hopefully these bones and ghosts will help chase those demons away.</p>
    <p>-Chef John</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 2 large egg whites </li>

        <li>2 drops fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        
        <li>7 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste </li>
        
        <li>2 chocolate chips, melted, or as needed </li>
        
      
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick, white, and foamy. Add sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly, until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape. </li>
        <li>Transfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet. Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more. </li>
        <li>Dip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate and dot chocolate "eyes" on each of the ghosts.</li>

    </ol>
