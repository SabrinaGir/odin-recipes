    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened </li>

        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar </li>
        
        <li>1 egg </li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon almond extract </li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        
        <li>2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        
        <li>¾ cup whole almonds </li>
        
        <li> 1 (.75 ounce) tube red decorating gel </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol>

        <li> Combine the butter, sugar, egg, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Beat together with an electric mixer; gradually add the flour, baking powder, and salt, continually beating; refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.</li>
        <li> Remove dough from refrigerator in small amounts. Scoop 1 heaping teaspoon at a time onto a piece of waxed paper. Use the waxed paper to roll the dough into a thin finger-shaped cookie. Press one almond into one end of each cookie to give the appearance of a long fingernail. Squeeze cookie near the tip and again near the center of each to give the impression of knuckles. You can also cut into the dough with a sharp knife at the same points to help give a more finger-like appearance. Arrange the shaped cookies on the baking sheets.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are slightly golden in color, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove the almond from the end of each cookie; squeeze a small amount of red decorating gel into the cavity; replace the almond to cause the gel to ooze out around the tip of the cookie. </li>
    </ol>
