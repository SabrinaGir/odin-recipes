    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> cooking spray </li>

        <li>15 craft sticks</li>
        
        <li>15 medium apples, washed and dried </li>
        
        <li>2 cups white sugar </li>
        
        <li>1 Â½ cups water </li>
        
        <li>1 cup light corn syrup </li>
        
        <li>8 drops red food coloring </li>
        
      
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol>

        <li> Lightly grease cookie sheets. Insert craft sticks into whole, stemmed apples.</li>
        <li> Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and insert candy thermometer; continue to boil, without stirring, until temperature reaches 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads. Remove from heat and stir in food coloring.</li>
        <li> Holding each apple by its stick, dip in syrup, remove and turn to coat evenly. Place on prepared sheets to harden.</li>
